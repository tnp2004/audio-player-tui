<img alt="preview" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tnp2004/audio-player-tui/main/preview.gif" width="500">

A small terminal-based audio player written in Go.
You can play audio files directly from your terminal — no GUI needed.

## Key Features
- Terminal UI interface for playback (play, pause, stop)
- Support for common audio file formats: .mp3, .wav
- Simple installation and run: built in Go, so just compile and run or use the binary
- Minimal dependencies: keep things lightweight and terminal-native
- Straightforward UI folder/file layout under audio/, model/, ui/, etc. (see repo structure)
